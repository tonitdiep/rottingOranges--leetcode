Leetcode # 994 Rotting Oranges (medium)

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

Example 1: 
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

Constraints:
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

 * @return {number}

    // let emptyCell = 0;
    // let freshO = 1;
    // let rottenO = 2;
    return -1
};
